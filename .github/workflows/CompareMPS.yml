          ### What to do?

          #### :+1: If this is expected

          Then you just have to update the MPS files running from the root of TulipaEnergyModel.jl:

          ```bash
          julia --project=. utils/scripts/model-mps-update.jl
          ```

          #### :-1: This is bad

          Then, review the log below to figure out why the files differ:

          <details>

          ```plaintext' > body.md
          cat mps-logfile.txt >> body.md
          echo '```

          </details>
          ' >> body.md
          echo "::warning title=MPS files are different::$(cat body.md)"
