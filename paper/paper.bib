  abstract      = {In order to achieve a timely transition towards sustainable energy systems within a large landscape of multi-sectors and multi-technologies, decision-makers and industry practitioners can rely on time- and space-discretized energy system optimization models. However, such models are often burdened by the computational costs arising from the growing problem complexity, which is especially due to the time discretization. The common strategy to lower the computational cost is to uniformly reduce the temporal resolution, sacrificing the quality of the solution. In light of this, we propose the concept and a formulation of fully flexible temporal resolution, wherein each decision variable and constraint can have a separate temporal resolution. After introducing the formulation in detail, we demonstrate its capability by applying it to an EU-wide case study optimizing both capacity investment and operation decisions of the inter-connected energy system across the different countries. We show that the proposed flexible formulation allows us to flexibly remove variables and constraints that are not needed without losing accuracy, and to simplify the time discretization (e.g., in space) while pushing the Pareto front by simultaneously speeding up computation and limiting losses in accuracy. In conclusion, we highlight the promise of adopting fully flexible temporal resolution and encourage future research to explore further temporal resolution configurations beyond our examples.}

  abstract      = {The transition towards more sustainable energy systems poses new requirements on energy system models. New challenges include representing more uncertainties, including short-term detail in long-term planning models, allowing for more integration across energy sectors, and dealing with increased model complexities. SpineOpt is a flexible, open-source, energy system modelling framework for performing operational and planning studies, consisting of a wide spectrum of novel tools and functionalities. The most salient features of SpineOpt include a generic data structure, flexible temporal and spatial structures, a comprehensive representation of uncertainties, and model decomposition capabilities to reduce the computational complexity. These enable the implementation of highly diverse case studies. SpineOpt's features are presented through several publicly-available applications. An illustrative case study presents the impact of different temporal resolutions and stochastic structures in a co-optimised electricity and gas network. Using a lower temporal resolution in different parts of the model leads to a lower computational time (44\%–98\% reductions), while the total system cost varies only slightly (-1.22–1.39\%). This implies that modellers experiencing computational issues should choose a high level of temporal accuracy only when needed.}
