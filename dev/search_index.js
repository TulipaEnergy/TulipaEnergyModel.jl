On Windows, if you are using the default Julia installation, search for C:/Users/ then the folder of your Windows user and then .julia/bin\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.activate(temp=true); Pkg.add(\"AirspeedVelocity\")'\nCheck that benchpkg was installed:\nbenchpkg --version\nIf if can't be found, then it is possible that your Julia bin folder is not in the PATH. After fixing this, try again.\nThen, run benchpkg with --rev to list the versions to be tested and --bench-on to indicate with script to use (if necessary). For instance:\nbenchpkg TulipaEnergyModel --rev=v0.12.0,main --bench-on=main\nAfter all logging, the output should look like\n|                                      | v0.12.0       | main            | v0.12.0/main |\n|:-------------------------------------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|\n| energy_problem/create_model          | 25.1 ± 1.2 s  | 19.7 ± 1.1 s    | 1.27         |\n| energy_problem/input_and_constructor | 11.2 ± 0.15 s | 8.57 ± 0.064 s  | 1.3          |\n| time_to_load                         | 1.7 ± 0.022 s | 1.73 ± 0.0055 s | 0.979        |\nBe aware that the versions passed in rev must be compatible to the benchmark defined at bench-on. So, for instance, testing v0.10.4 above would fail, before the versions are too different.\nIf you are working on a local version of TulipaEnergyModel, it is possible to test the local modifications. First, make sure that you are at the root of the TulipaEnergyModel repo, and then issue\nbenchpkg --rev=<other>,dirty\nThe dirty value refers to the current local modifications. The <other> values can be tags or branches to compare.\nWhen this is done, you can print just the table afterwards using benchmarktable:\nbenchpkgtable TulipaEnergyModel --rev=v0.12.0,main\n...\n|                                      | v0.12.0       | main            | v0.12.0/main |\n|:-------------------------------------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|\n| energy_problem/create_model          | 25.1 ± 1.2 s  | 19.7 ± 1.1 s    | 1.27         |\n| energy_problem/input_and_constructor | 11.2 ± 0.15 s | 8.57 ± 0.064 s  | 1.3          |\n| time_to_load                         | 1.7 ± 0.022 s | 1.73 ± 0.0055 s | 0.979        |\nIt is also possible to generate a plot, using benchpkgplot:\nbenchpkgplot TulipaEnergyModel --rev=v0.12.0,main --format=jpeg\nDifferent formats can be used.

This constraint only involves units_on variables because the flow above the minimum operating point at timestep block 4:4 differs from the previous timestep block 3:3 only in terms of the units_on variables. As a result, the ramping-up constraint establishes a relationship between the units_on variable at 1:3 and 4:6. This means that if the unit is on at timestep 1:3, then it must also be on at timestep 4:6.
