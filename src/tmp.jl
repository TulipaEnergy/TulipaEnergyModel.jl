    tmp_create_partition_tables(connection)

Create the unrolled partition tables using only tables.

The table `explicit_assets_rep_periods_partitions` is the explicit version of
`assets_rep_periods_partitions`, i.e., it adds the rows not defined in that
table by setting the specification to 'uniform' and the partition to '1'.

The table `asset_time_resolution` is the unrolled version of the table above,
i.e., it takes the specification and partition and expands into a series of
time blocks. The columns `time_block_start` and `time_block_end` replace the
`specification` and `partition` columns.

Similarly, `flow` tables are created as well.

    # These are generic tables to be used to create some variables and constraints
    # Following the lowest resolution merge strategy

    # The logic:
    # - t_union is ordered by groups (asset, year, rep_period), so every new group starts the same way
    # - Inside a group, time blocks (TBs) are ordered by time_block_start, so the
    #   first row of every group starts at time_block_start = 1
    # - The objective of the lowest resolution is to iteratively find the
    #   smallest interval [s, e] that covers all blocks that (i) haven't been
    #   covered yet; and (ii) start at s or earlier.
    # - We start with an interval [1, e], then use use s = e + 1 for the next intervals
    # - To cover all blocks, we use e as the largest time_block_end of the relevant blocks
    # - Since the TBs are in order, we can simply loop over them until we find
    #   the first that starts later than s. That will be the beginning of a new TB

    # Example:
    # Consider a group with two assets/flows with the following time resolutions:
    #
    # 1: 1:3 4:6 7:9 10:12
    # 2: 1:2 3:7 8:8 9:11 12:12
    #
    # The expected lowest resolution is: 1:3 4:7 8:9 10:12
    #
    # This will be translated into the following rows (TBS ordered, not
    # necessarily TBE ordered), and ROW is the row number only for our example
    #
    # ROW TBS  TBE
    #   1   1    3
    #   2   1    2
    #   3   3    7
    #   4   4    6
    #   5   7    9
    #   6   8    8
    #   7   9   11
    #   8  10   12
    #   9  12   12
    #
    # Here's how the algorithm behaves:
    #
    # - BEGINNING OF GROUP, set s = 1, e = 0
    # - ROW 1, TB =  [1,  3]: TBS = 1 ≤ 1 = s, so e = max(e, TBE) = max(0, 3) = 3
    # - ROW 2, TB =  [1,  2]: TBS = 1 ≤ 1 = s, so e = max(e, TBE) = max(3, 2) = 3
    # - ROW 3, TB =  [3,  7]: TBS = 3 > 1 = s, so the first block is created: [s, e] = [1, 3].
    #       Start a new block with s = 3 + 1 = 4 and e = TBE = 7
    # - ROW 4, TB =  [4,  6]: TBS = 4 ≤ 4 = s, so e = max(e, TBE) = max(7, 6) = 7
    # - ROW 5, TB =  [7,  9]: TBS = 7 > 4 = s, so the second block is created: [s, e] = [4, 7].
    #       Start a new block with s = 7 + 1 = 8 and e = TBE = 9
    # - ROW 6, TB =  [8,  8]: TBS = 8 ≤ 8 = s, so e = max(e, TBE) = max(9, 8) = 9
    # - ROW 7, TB =  [9, 11]: TBS = 9 > 8 = s, so the third block is created: [s, e] = [8, 9].
    #       Start a new block with s = 9 + 1 = 10 and e = TBE = 11
    # - ROW 8, TB = [10, 12]: TBS = 10 ≤ 10 = s, so e = max(e, TBE) = max(11, 12) = 12

    The desired incoming and outgoing flows are:
    - ep.dataframes[:highest_in_out].incoming_flow
    - ep.dataframes[:highest_in_out].outgoing_flow

    The DuckDB relevant tables (created in this file) are
    - `asset_time_resolution`: Each asset and their unrolled time partitions
    - `flow_time_resolution`: Each flow and their unrolled time partitions
      Note: This is the equivalent to `ep.dataframes[:flows]`.
    - `cons_indices_highest_in_out`: The indices of the balance constraints.

    Objectives:
    - For each row in `cons_indices_highest_in_out`, find all incoming/outgoing
      flows that **match** (asset,year,rep_period) and with intersecting time
      block
    - Find a way to store this information to use when creating the model in a
      way that doesn't slow down when creating constraints/expressions in JuMP.
      This normally implies not having conditionals on the expresion/constraints.
      See, e.g., https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/sum_if/
