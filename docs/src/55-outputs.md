# [Output Variables](@id outputs)

Tulipa's user workflow is a work-in-progress. For now, you can export the complete raw solution to CSV files using [`TulipaEnergyModel.export_solution_to_csv_files`](@ref).
Below is a description of the exported data. Files may be missing if the associated features were not included in the analysis.

## Output Tables Format

There are two types of outputs:

1. **Variables:** All tables/files starting with `var_`show the values of variables in the optimal solution, with leading columns specifying the indices of each `solution` value.

1. **Duals:** All tables/files starting with `cons_` show the dual value in the optimal solution for each constraint, with leading columns specifying the indices of each `dual` value. Remember that the dual represents *the incremental change in the optimal solution per unit increase in the right-hand-side (bound) of the constraint* - which in a minimal cost optimisation corresponds to an increase in cost.

!!! note "Units"
    TulipaEnergyModel is inherently unitless, meaning the units are directly taken from the input data. For example, if all costs are given in thousands of euros, then the objective function is also in thousands of euros. So a "change in the objective function" would mean a â‚¬1k increase/decrease.

Each output table has three types of columns:

1. Indices: Parameters on which the output variable or dual is indexed, including:
   - `asset`: Unique name of the asset.
   - `from_asset`: For a flow, the origin asset.
   - `to_asset`: For a flow, the terminal asset.
   - `year`: Equivalent to `milestone_year`. (Will be fixed in future release.)
   - `milestone_year`: Year of investment and operation decisions.
   - `commission_year`: Commissioning year of an asset (used for unique asset identification).
   - `rep_period`: Number of the representative period.
   - `time_block_start`: Start of the time block of the representative period.
   - `time_block_end`: End of the time block of the representative period.
   - `period_block_start`: Start of the time block of the timeframe (mostly relevant for seasonal storage).
   - `period_block_end`: Start of the time block of the timeframe (mostly relevant for seasonal storage).
2. Associated [input parameters](@ref schemas): Listed per table below
3. `Solution` or `dual_constraint_name`: Value of the variable or dual in the solution, described below.
